# For a Windows build, you might need to cross-compile this way:
#
#CCOMP=i686-w64-mingw32-gcc
#CCNAT=gcc
#
# Note that for Emscripten builds you might also have to define these to
# compile assets necessary to build the emulator.

# In case a test build (debug) is necessary, give 'test' here. It enables
# extra assertions, and compiles the program with no optimizations, debug
